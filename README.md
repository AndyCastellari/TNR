# TNR
Binary data analysis libraries and utilities

This project aims to make analysis of binary data files available to non-programmers by allowing them to define the logical structure of binary files using JSON and then using the tnrtool utility to convert between binary and textual format.
The tool requires a template in JSON, an input file and an output file; by default the tool converts text to binary but addition of the command line option --binary-text reverses the mode of operation.

For example,

  tnrtool -t testObject.json --if testObject.bin --of temp.txt --binary-text

Decodes testObject.bin to temp.txt using the template in testObject.json and,

  tnrtool -t testObject.json --if temp.txt --of testObject.bin

Creates a new testObject.bin based on temp3.txt. 

It is possible to decode a binary file, edit the text file and recreate a binary file with new values.

o libTNR contains the headers and source for the library
o TNR_tester contains unit tests
o tnrtool contains the source for the command line utility

Makefiles were generated by Eclipe: use make all and make clean in the Debug or Release directories to build.
